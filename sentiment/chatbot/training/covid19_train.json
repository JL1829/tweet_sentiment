        "You should perform contactless transactions and ensure items are bagged securely to reduce exposure to others. This means food/groceries will need to be delivered for the household. You should also maintain a high level of personal hygiene by washing your hands regularly with soap and practice good bathroom etiquette, e.g. close the lid before you flush. For other instances where you need to perform daily functions from within the room, for example, collect meals, have laundry changed or clear trash, below are simple tips that you can follow, so as to ensure the safety of your household members supporting you with managing these daily necessities: Ensure no one from the household is near the doorway to your room; Put on a surgical mask before opening the door; Handle your items in ways to reduce the need for family members to come into direct contact with them as much as possible, such as: Dedicate a set of utensils for your meals, do not share dishes, drinking cups, cutlery etc. Your family may wash your used utensils together with theirs; Place your laundry in a bag at your door. Your family may wash your soiled laundry together with theirs, but they should empty your bag of laundry directly into the washing machine and avoid handling your soiled clothes with their bare hands; Place your secured, double-bagged trash at the door for your family to help dispose of. Your family should throw the bag directly into the rubbish chute immediately; Inform the other members of the household of the above, so they can collect the rubbish/laundry/eating utensils\nWash your hands with soap and water regularly or where applicable. If you do not have an attached bathroom within the isolation room, ensure everyone practices proper hygiene and disinfects the bathroom after each use. These are some examples to help the household manage: designate specific bathroom for the patient\u2019s usage and other household members should use another bathroom; if a single bathroom has to be shared, after use, lower the lid before flushing. User should clean and disinfect after each use for contact surfaces and do not use for at least 20 minutes immediately after the patient\u2019s usage. If you live alone and need to collect deliveries at the door, below are simple tips that you can follow: Place a hook at the door and ask the delivery man to hang the delivered groceries or food there for contactless delivery; Ensure that the delivery man has left and no one is within the vicinity of your doorway; Put on a surgical mask before opening the door; Collect your deliveries and close the door; Do not interact with anyone; Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or where applicable."

During the journey, wind down the windows and sit alone in the back seat during the journey. You should not make any stops along the way. Should you decide to isolate at your place of residence, you may not switch the isolation venue (i.e. decide to return to the hotel again, and vice versa) during the isolation period.",

        "Persons with moderate to severe immunocompromise are recommended to receive four doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, comprising a three-dose enhanced primary series and a booster dose for the fourth dose. There is currently no recommendation for a second booster (i.e. fifth vaccine dose) for this group. Some immunocompromised persons may have followed the vaccination regime recommended for the general population and received the third dose as a booster dose after receiving the first two doses as part of the primary series). In consultation with their doctors, these patients should receive a fourth dose of the vaccine at around five months after their third dose. The recommendation for immunocompromised persons to receive four doses applies to persons aged 12 years and above.
